Synchronize file trees using version vectors.


To prevent losing data, or to read and modify the data in multiple places,
make multiple file trees and synchronize them.

To detect which tree should replace the other,
or that both have changed and the user must reconcile them,
the program stores metadata in the file .vector-sync in the tree's root.
The leading dot (.) is a Linux convention for such files.
Any other .vector-sync item in the file tree is an error.
Any empty directory in the file tree is an error.
