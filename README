Synchronize file trees using version vectors.


To prevent losing data, or to read and modify the data in multiple places,
make multiple file trees and synchronize them.

To detect which tree should replace the other,
or that both have changed and the user must make them identical,
the program stores metadata in the file .vector-sync in the tree's root.
The leading dot (.) is a Linux convention for such files.
Any other .vector-sync item in the file tree is an error.
Any empty directory in the file tree is an error.


§ Run

./main.py --help
./main.py init --help
./main.py sync --help


§ New tree metadata

Initializing a new tree with name ‘MyTree’ writes the metadata:
{
  "id": "MyTree",
  "version_vector": {},
  "file_hashes": {}
}


§ File Hashes

The metadata stores {"path/to/file": "hash of content", …}.


§ Version Vectors

A version vector is a map from tree IDs (strings) to counters (integers).
In principle, when a tree changes, its counter is incremented if present,
else added as 1.

X < Y ⇔ X ≠ Y and each ID in X is present in Y with an equal or higher counter.
In principle, X is before Y and can be replaced by Y and Y's file tree.

{}		< {A:1}
{A:1}		≮ {A:1}
{A:1}		< {A:2, B:3}
{A:1, B:2}	≮ {B:3}
{A:1, B:2}	≮ {A:3, B:1}
{A:1, B:2}	< {A:1, B:3}

X ⊔ Y (join) has all IDs in X and Y.
An ID's counter is the maximum of its counters in X and Y
if it is present in both,
else its counter from X or Y where it is present.
In principle, synchronizing version vectors X and Y results in X ⊔ Y.

{A:1} ⊔ {A:2}	= {A:2}
{A:1} ⊔ {B:2}	= {A:1, B:2}
{A:1, B:4, C:2, D:6} ⊔ {B:3, C:2, D:7, E:9} = {A:1, B:4, C:2, D:7, E:9}


§ Synchronizing two file trees, A and B

If a tree differs from its metadata,
increment the counter for its ID in its version vector (set it to 1 if absent).
This is calculated in memory, not written to disk.

If the trees are identical, do nothing.
Else if Va < Vb, replace tree A with B.
Else if Vb < Va, replace tree B with A.
Else stop: the user must make the trees identical then run the sync again.

Now the file trees are identical.
Record the file tree and Va ⊔ Vb in the metadata of A and B.
