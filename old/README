§ Synchronizing trees A and B

If a tree differs from its metadata,
increment the counter for its ID in its version vector
(set it to 1 if it is absent).
This is calculated in memory, not written to disk yet.

If the trees are identical, record them, and Va ⊔ Vb, in the metadata.
Else if Va < Vb, use tree B and Vb.
Else if Vb < Va, use tree A and Va.
Else error: the user must reconcile the trees then run the sync again.
